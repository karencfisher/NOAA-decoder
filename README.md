# NOAA APT Decoder Application

MVP for an application to translate raw data files recorded from NOAA satellites
to JPG images.

Run decode.py (or the decode.exe once it works), and click the "Open" file to open a .WAV file for satellite data. The app immdiately decodes and displays the image (on my machine it taks under one minute). You can the save it as JPG.
